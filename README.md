## Running the Application

Using Raider Wagers is easy. There is nothing to install or commands to run. Instead, all you have to do is follow this link: https://mirandae776.github.io/raider-wagers/

## What can I do?
Many major features have been implemented in the application. The first feature is viewing and placing bets. The application fetches games and props from a server, and gives you the ability to place bets on them. Once you place a bet, you can view and cancel them up to the time the game starts. 

### User Login
Immediately upon loading up the application, you're presented with a login screen. Through the use of a user account, your personal betting history and dabloon balance are safe and sound. The username follows the format: _username_@msoe.edu where _username_ is your MSOE email and the password is "password".

### Placing a Wager
Navigating to the 'Place a Bet' screen by clicking on _Place a Bet_. Next, you will be prompted with several events that you can bet your hard-earned dabloons on. Selecting an event fetches the various props that could occur during the game, along with their odds. You can then select one of these props to place your dabloons on, and once you confirm your bet, it's placed!

### Viewing your Betting History
You can also navigate to the Betting History page to see what bets you've made by clicking _Betting History_. From here, you can view stats about the bet, and you're also presented with the option to cancel the bet, as long as the event hasn't started. 

### Navigating the Application
The application features a Navigation Bar that allows you to easily return to the Home Page by clicking on the home icon. In addition, the application has been optimized for use with the builtin browser navigation buttons. For example, you accidentally select the wrong game, you can click the back arrow in your browser to go back to the Events Page!
