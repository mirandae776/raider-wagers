## Running the Application

Using raider wagers is easy, all you have to do is follow this link: https://mirandae776.github.io/raider-wagers/

## What can I do?
The Raider Wagers application is still a work in progress, but even still, there are several features that you as a user can make use of.

### User login
Immediately upon loading up the application, you're presented with a login screen. Through the use of a user account, your personal betting history and doubloon count are safe and sound. The username is "user@msoe.edu" and the password is "password".

### Making a wager
Navigating to the 'place a bet' screen via the home page, you will be prompted about several events with which you can bet your hard earned Doubloons on. Selecting an event brings you then to various props that could take place during a game, along with their odds. You can then select one of these props to place your doubloons on, and your bet is saved on our servers.

### Viewing your betting history
Returning to the home page, you can also navigate to the betting history page to see what bets you've made. From here, you can stats about the bet, and are also presented with the option to cancel the bet, as long as the event hasn't passed.
